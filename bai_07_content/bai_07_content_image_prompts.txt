Slide 3: Create a minimalist, flat design icon set representing the concepts of "Present," "Analyze," and "Apply."  Each icon should be distinct and visually communicate its corresponding concept.

* **Present:**  A stylized, closed history book with a simple bookmark extending from the top. Use a muted, sophisticated color palette of deep teal for the book and a lighter, contrasting teal for the bookmark.  The background for this icon should be a soft, off-white.  Lighting should be even and flat, as if lit from directly above.

* **Analyze:** A simple line graph depicting upward trending data, represented by a thin, white line on a rich burgundy background.  The graph should have minimalistic axes, indicated by thin white lines as well.  Maintain the flat, even lighting as with the "Present" icon.

* **Apply:** A bright, glowing lightbulb icon with subtle, radiating lines emanating from it to suggest illumination. The lightbulb itself should be a vibrant, golden yellow, and the radiating lines a slightly lighter, more transparent yellow.  The background for this icon should be a deep navy blue to create a strong contrast and emphasize the "bright idea" concept.  Maintain the flat aesthetic, but allow for a subtle inner glow within the lightbulb to enhance the sense of illumination.

The overall style should be clean, modern, and vector-based, suitable for use in a professional context.  The icons should be individually rendered, allowing for flexible arrangement and usage.

Slide 4: A striking collage juxtaposing two contrasting cityscapes.  The left half depicts a vibrant, interconnected modern metropolis, teeming with life. Buildings reach skyward, glowing with warm interior lights, connected by a network of shimmering, energetic lines representing data flow and communication. Flying vehicles zip between skyscrapers, and holographic advertisements flicker in the air.  Use a vibrant, slightly futuristic color palette with blues, pinks, and oranges dominating. The style should be photorealistic with a touch of cyberpunk influence.  Lighting should be dynamic, with a mix of neon glows, streetlights, and the soft glow of screens reflecting in the glassy surfaces of the buildings. The right half presents a starkly different scene: a desolate, disconnected city in muted grey tones. Buildings are crumbling and devoid of light. Overlaid on this greyscale cityscape are large, red "X" marks slashing through universally recognized symbols of connectivity: Wi-Fi logos, social media icons, and @ symbols.  The streets are empty, giving a sense of isolation and quiet.  The style here should also be photorealistic, but with a gritty, almost post-apocalyptic feel.  Lighting should be minimal, perhaps a single, weak light source casting long shadows, enhancing the feeling of abandonment.  The overall composition should emphasize the stark contrast between the two halves, creating a powerful visual commentary on the importance of connection in the modern world.
