Slide 3: **Image Description:**

A flat 2D infographic illustration for a lecture slide, showcasing a set of five distinct, minimalist icons arranged horizontally on a neutral light-gray background. The icons are visually consistent in style, line weight, and color palette, which primarily uses educational blue, orange, and white.

From left to right, the icons are:
1.  **Robot Icon:** A simple, friendly robot with a square head, circular eyes, and a body with basic limbs, rendered in blue and white.
2.  **Hierarchy Icon:** A classic organizational chart diagram, with a top node connected by lines to three subordinate nodes below it, symbolizing a hierarchical structure.
3.  **5 Steps Icon:** A side view of a staircase with exactly five distinct steps, illustrating progression or a five-level process. The steps are colored in a gradient from light blue to dark blue.
4.  **Cloud/Transformation Icon:** A simple cloud shape with two curved arrows inside, forming a circular motion. This icon represents data synchronization, transformation, or cloud processes.
5.  **Greenhouse Icon:** A minimalist representation of a greenhouse, with a simple frame and transparent panels. A small green sprout is visible inside, symbolizing growth or a controlled environment.

The overall image is clean, clear, and perfectly suited for an educational context, with soft, even lighting and no text.

prompt
A 2x2 grid collage illustrating concepts of smart agriculture, in a flat 2D infographic style.

1.  **Top-left panel:** A simple white robotic arm is carefully picking a ripe red strawberry from a green plant.
2.  **Top-right panel:** An agricultural drone is flying low over a field of green crops, spraying a fine mist from its nozzles.
3.  **Bottom-left panel:** A soil moisture sensor probe is stuck in brown earth, with a small green sprout nearby.
4.  **Bottom-right panel:** A clean, standard black and white QR code.

The entire image has a consistent, minimalist educational style with clean lines and a clear, unified color palette (blue, green, orange, gray) against a neutral light gray background. Soft, even lighting suitable for a lecture slide.

Slide 10: *   **Image Description:** A minimalist 2x2 grid of four flat-style infographic icons on a light gray background, each illustrating a specific challenge.
    *   **Top-left:** An icon representing fragmentation, shown as several disconnected blue puzzle pieces.
    *   **Top-right:** An icon for weak infrastructure, depicted as a gray Wi-Fi signal symbol with a bold orange slash through it.
    *   **Bottom-left:** An icon for cost, visualized as a simple stack of gray coins with a dollar sign.
    *   **Bottom-right:** An icon for lack of personnel, illustrated by a blue person silhouette with a large orange question mark over their head.

Slide 11: /imagine prompt: An educational illustration for a lecture slide, split vertically into two distinct scenes. On the left side, a cutaway view of a modern, high-tech greenhouse in a flat 2D infographic style. Inside the greenhouse, show neat rows of green plants. Above the plants, hang minimalist LED grow lights emitting a soft purple and white glow. Include a simple icon-like fan on the wall for air circulation and a misting system spraying a fine vapor over the plants. The structure of the greenhouse is clean, with gray metallic beams and transparent walls. On the right side, a vast, open agricultural field, also in a flat 2D infographic style. The field is divided into long, parallel tilled rows of soil with small green crops growing. A black drip irrigation tube runs along the base of each row, with tiny water droplets shown at the base of each plant. The background shows a clear blue sky with a simple sun. The overall visual style is minimalist and educational, with a clear color distinction: the greenhouse side uses cooler tones (grays, purples), while the field side uses warmer tones (browns, bright greens, light blue). Use a soft, neutral lighting scheme. --ar 16:9 --style raw --v 6.0

Slide 14: _Initial thought process: The user wants an image of a simple mind map to summarize a 5-point lesson agenda. This is a classic diagrammatic concept.

1.  **Core Concept:** Mind map structure. This means a central idea with branches leading to sub-ideas.
2.  **Key Elements:**
    *   One central topic.
    *   Five sub-topics connected to the center.
3.  **Visual Style:** Flat 2D infographic, minimalist, educational.
4.  **Iconography:**
    *   The central topic should represent the "main idea" or "lesson." A lightbulb, a brain, or an open book are excellent universal symbols for this.
    *   The five sub-topics should be represented by distinct, generic icons that suggest different types of agenda items (e.g., introduction, technical detail, data, concept, summary). This avoids the need for text while still showing they are different points.
    *   Good icon choices: a document icon, a code block icon (`</>`), a flowchart icon, a bar chart icon, and a checkmark icon.
5.  **Layout:** A radial layout is the most natural for a mind map. Place the central idea in the middle and arrange the five sub-topics evenly around it. This creates a balanced and easy-to-read composition.
6.  **Color:** Use a simple, educational palette. A primary color (like blue) for the central theme, a neutral color (like gray) for the structure, and an accent color (like orange) for the icons to make them pop. The background should be neutral (light gray or white).
7.  **Text:** The user explicitly stated "no text," but also allows for essential clarifications. The request is for a summary of "5 ý chính" (5 main points). Adding the numbers 1 through 5 next to each point will visually reinforce this structure without adding distracting words. This is a perfect use of the "essential text" exception.

**Final Image Plan:**

*   **Center:** A blue circle containing a white lightbulb icon, representing the main lesson topic.
*   **Branches:** Simple gray lines radiating from the central circle.
*   **Nodes:** Five smaller circles at the end of each branch.
*   **Content:** Each of the five circles will contain a distinct orange icon and be accompanied by a number (1-5) to clearly delineate the five points of the agenda. The icons will be: 1. Document, 2. Code Block, 3. Flowchart, 4. Bar Chart, 5. Checkmark.
*   **Background:** A very light, neutral gray to ensure high contrast.
*   **Overall Style:** Clean, flat, and perfectly suited for a lecture slide.

This design is a direct, clear, and visually appealing representation of the requested concept, following all constraints perfectly.

_Final check: Does this look like an educational illustration? Yes. Is it minimalist and 2D? Yes. Does it handle text correctly? Yes, only essential numbers. Is the color palette appropriate? Yes. Does it avoid the forbidden elements? Yes. The plan is solid._


![A minimalist 2D infographic illustrating a simple mind map. In the center is a large blue circle with a white lightbulb icon, symbolizing the main lesson idea. Radiating outwards from the center are five gray lines, each connecting to a smaller gray circle. These five nodes are arranged symmetrically around the central topic. Each node is numbered from 1 to 5 and contains a simple, distinct orange icon. Node 1 has a document icon. Node 2 has a code block icon. Node 3 has a flowchart icon. Node 4 has a bar chart icon. Node 5 has a checkmark icon.

  "visual_description": "A minimalist educational illustration in a flat 2D infographic style. On a light gray background, the image shows a logical progression from left to right. On the left, a single stylized person icon in dark gray is shown with a large, bright orange question mark icon (?) inside a circle above it, signifying a question. A subtle, dashed gray arrow points from this left group to the right. On the right, a group of three stylized person icons are gathered, representing a team or class. Above them are multiple overlapping speech bubble icons in shades of blue and orange, symbolizing an active discussion. The overall visual is clean, with a clear color palette of blue, orange, gray, and white, and uses soft, even lighting consistent with an educational diagram. The composition clearly visualizes the concept of a question leading to a discussion."
