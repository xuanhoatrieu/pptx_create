The color palette is dominated by electric blue and cyan, with crisp white for the text. Highly detailed, vector graphics, sharp focus, professional corporate presentation.

Slide 6: A sleek 3D render of a circular infographic chart with a minimalist vector style, isolated on a clean, light-gray background. The chart is divided into four distinct quadrants. In the center, the word "TRENDS" is prominently displayed in a bold, modern sans-serif font. Each quadrant represents a technology, featuring a title, a simple icon, and a short tagline:

*   **The first quadrant**, in a vibrant tech-blue, is labeled "AI" and showcases a stylized icon of a robotic brain with glowing circuits.
*   **The second quadrant**, in a fresh teal-green, is labeled "IoT" and features a minimalist icon of a smart home with connectivity waves.
*   **The third quadrant**, in a deep, insightful purple, is labeled "Big Data" and displays a clean icon of a dynamic bar chart.
*   **The fourth quadrant**, in a solid, trustworthy slate-gray, is labeled "Blockchain" and presents an icon of interconnected, secure blocks.

The lighting is soft and ambient, casting subtle, gentle shadows that give the elements a slight lift and a sense of depth. The overall aesthetic is polished, professional, and visually balanced, with a sophisticated and harmonious color palette.

Slide 7: A sleek, minimalist, conceptual 3D render of three ascending, polished steps, creating a powerful metaphor for a journey of evolution. The first and lowest step, a solid foundational block, is cleanly engraved with "Digitization" and emits a cool, stable blue glow. The middle step, appearing more actively constructed, is engraved with "Digitalization" and radiates a vibrant teal light. The third and highest step, sleek and almost aerodynamic, is engraved with "Digital Transformation" and shines with a brilliant white intensity. Launching vertically from this top step is a dynamic, energetic arrow of light in a brilliant, warm gold, leaving a subtle trail of sparkling particles that signifies takeoff. The entire structure is set against a deep, dark, abstract space with a faint, out-of-focus digital grid in the background. The lighting is dramatic and cinematic, with the glowing steps and arrow serving as the primary light sources, casting soft shadows and creating sharp, glossy highlights. The color palette is sophisticated and progressive: deep blue, vibrant teal, brilliant white, and a climactic burst of gold.

Slide 8: A clean vector illustration in an infographic style, presented as a "Before and After" diptych. On the left "Before" panel, a stack of physical paper documents and a vintage audio cassette tape. In the center, a large, bold arrow points right, with the word "Digitization" clearly labeled on it. On the right "After" panel, a sleek modern computer screen displays a crisp PDF file icon and an MP3 file icon. **Style:** Minimalist flat design with sharp lines and universally recognizable iconography. **Lighting:** Bright, even, and ambient, casting soft, subtle shadows to give a slight sense of depth without compromising the clean aesthetic. **Color Palette:** A professional and modern palette dominated by cool blues, teals, and neutral grays, with a single vibrant orange or green accent for the central arrow to emphasize the transformation process, all set against a clean, light-gray background.

Slide 9: A clean, modern infographic with a split-screen design comparing an old process versus a new process.

**Subject:**
- **On the left panel, "The Old Process":** A sequence of minimalist icons depicts a character writing a physical letter with a fountain pen, sealing it in an envelope, and dropping it into a classic red postbox. A dotted line connects these slow, multi-step actions. Below, data visualization shows a large clock icon labeled "Time: Days" and a stack of coins for "Cost: High."
- **On the right panel, "The New Process":** A single, dynamic illustration shows the same character at a sleek, modern computer, decisively clicking a glowing "Send" button on an email interface. An email icon flies instantly from the screen. Below, the corresponding data shows a tiny sliver on the clock icon labeled "Time: Seconds" and a single coin for "Cost: Low."

**Setting:** A clean, abstract background, divided vertically. The left side has a subtle parchment texture, while the right side is a clean, digital grid.

**Style:** Flat 2D vector illustration, minimalist, corporate presentation style, with sharp lines and clear, intuitive iconography.

**Lighting:** Bright, even, and clean studio lighting with no harsh shadows, ensuring maximum readability and a professional feel.

Slide 16: A minimalist 3-step infographic, 3D render in a clean claymorphism style. The subject consists of three distinct, soft-form icons arranged horizontally: a lightbulb for 'Idea' (Step 1), interlocking gears for 'Process' (Step 2), and a simple rocket for 'Launch' (Step 3). Each icon is accompanied by a large, stylized number. The setting is an uncluttered, infinite plane with a subtle gradient. The lighting is soft and diffused, as if from a large studio softbox, creating gentle, smooth shadows that give the objects a tangible, soft-plastic feel. The color palette is modern and harmonious, using a light grey background with vibrant pastel accents—like soft teal, coral, and lavender—for each of the three steps to ensure they are visually distinct yet cohesive.

Slide 17: A minimalist triptych of three distinct icons, arranged horizontally, representing a journey of strategic growth. **Subject:** The first icon features three clean, ascending steps. The second icon is a human head silhouette in profile, containing interlocking gears and a simple upward-trending chart, symbolizing a strategic mindset. The third icon is a perfectly balanced scale, holding an upward arrow (opportunity) on one side and an exclamation mark (challenge) on the other. **Style:** Clean 2D flat design, vector illustration, minimalist aesthetic with sharp lines and geometric precision. **Setting:** Isolated on a solid, light grey background for a professional and uncluttered look. **Lighting:** Bright, even, and diffused studio light, creating no shadows and enhancing the flat graphic quality. **Color Palette:** A cohesive corporate color scheme using a deep navy blue, a vibrant accent teal, and crisp white, creating high contrast and visual clarity.

Slide 18: A highly detailed 3D render of a large, brilliant question mark glowing with a powerful white-blue light at the center of the frame. Orbiting this central symbol are multiple semi-transparent, ethereal thought bubbles. Inside each bubble, key concepts are clearly written in a clean, modern sans-serif font: "Banking", "Rural vs Urban", "Soft Skills", "AI", "Future Career", "Economy". The style is sleek, modern, and conceptual. The setting is a dark, abstract void with a subtle, faint digital grid pattern in the deep blue background, creating a sense of depth and technology. The lighting is dramatic and high-contrast, with the question mark being the primary source of light, casting volumetric rays and soft highlights onto the surrounding bubbles. The color palette is cool and sophisticated, dominated by deep navy blues, blacks, and the radiant white and electric blue of the central light source.

Slide 19: Professional graphic design of a formal presentation slide, minimalist and clean layout.

**Subject:** A contact information slide for a lecturer. In the lower-left corner, crisp, white sans-serif typography displays placeholder text: "Email: [email protected]" and "Office: 301, Science Building". A subtle, semi-transparent dark overlay ensures the text is perfectly legible.

**Setting:** The background is a high-resolution, photorealistic image of a modern, empty university lecture hall, seen from the stage. The hall features sleek architecture with warm wood paneling and cool concrete accents, tiered seating, and a large, blank projection screen. The background is slightly out of focus (soft bokeh) to draw attention to the foreground text.

**Style:** Photorealistic background with a clean UI/UX overlay. The overall feel is professional, academic, and sophisticated, suitable for a university or corporate presentation template.

**Lighting:** The lecture hall is bathed in soft, diffused natural light from large, off-camera windows, creating a bright, airy, and inviting atmosphere with subtle shadows.
